# Reason behind this
Primarily this is intended at creating functional utilities for common methods on the `Iterator` and `HashMap`'s in `Rust`

# Getting started
```
cargo install
cargo run
```

# Contribution
Add utility function if you think might be a useful as a more function-based ** not functional ;) ** approach
