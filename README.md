# Reason behind this
Primarily this is intended at creating functional utilities for common methods on the `Iterator` and `HashMap`'s in `Rust`

# Getting started
```
cargo install
cargo run
```

# Benchmark test
In order to compare the relative performance of the functions against there corresponding native `Iteratot` methods, there are some benchmark tests in the `benches` folder. Run the command to see the becnhmark comparison

```rust
cargo bench
```

Some results of the tests are already present [here](https://github.com/addityasingh/sknife/blob/master/benches/RESULT.md)

# Contribution
Add utility function if you think might be a useful as a more function-based ** not functional ;) ** approach
